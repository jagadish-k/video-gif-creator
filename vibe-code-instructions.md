# Vibe Code Instructions

This document captures all instructions, decisions, and context from the development session for this video-to-GIF converter application.

## Session Overview

**Project**: Browser-based Video to GIF Converter
**Date**: October 2, 2025
**AI Assistant**: Claude Code
**Developer**: Human (collaborative session)

## Initial Requirements

### Core Functionality
- Create a React SPA that allows users to upload video files
- Preview videos in the browser
- Select time ranges for conversion
- Generate GIFs entirely client-side (no backend)
- Deploy to GitHub Pages

### Tech Stack Specified
- **Framework**: React 18+ with TypeScript
- **Routing**: React Router v6
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS + OriginUI component library
- **Video Processing**: ffmpeg.wasm for client-side conversion
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages (client-side only)

## Key Instructions & Decisions

### 1. Project Initialization
**Instruction**: "Read project-instructions.md and scaffold this application following all the specifications"

**Actions Taken**:
- Initialized Vite project with React TypeScript template
- Set up TailwindCSS v4 (important: v4 syntax differs from v3)
- Installed all dependencies: react-router-dom, @ffmpeg/ffmpeg, @ffmpeg/util
- Created directory structure: components, pages, hooks, utils, types

**Key Decision**: Use TailwindCSS v4 with `@import "tailwindcss"` syntax instead of `@tailwind` directives

### 2. UI Layout Issues
**Issue**: "The UI is all over the place. The icons are huge and everything appears to be stacked vertically. When a video file is selected, I see a loading button at the bottom that doesn't change state."

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. TailwindCSS v4 wasn't loading properly (wrong import syntax)
2. FFmpeg loading from unpkg had CORS issues
3. useFFmpeg hook needed useCallback to prevent infinite re-renders

**Fixes Applied**:
- Changed `src/index.css` to use `@import "tailwindcss";`
- Updated `postcss.config.js` to use `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin
- Switched FFmpeg CDN from unpkg to jsDelivr (`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@ffmpeg/core@0.12.6/dist/esm`)
- Wrapped `load` function in `useCallback` in `useFFmpeg.ts`

### 3. Scaling Feature Request
**Instruction**: "I would like to add the ability to scale down the gif while maintaining the aspect ratio"

**Implementation**:
- Added width slider control (range input)
- Quality preset buttons (480p/720p/1080p) that set initial width
- Real-time aspect ratio calculation
- Display format: `{width} × {height}px` above slider
- Slider range: from min(200, videoWidth) to original video width

**Key Decision**: Quality presets set both quality AND width, while slider allows fine-tuning

### 4. Responsive Design Requirement
**Instruction**: "During the 'Edit & Generate GIF' step, show the controls on the right side next to the preview, on a desktop screen. It's fine to be displayed below in a mobile screen. Responsive design is key for adaptability and adoptibility in users"

**Initial Approach** (didn't work):
- Tried grid layout with `lg:grid-cols-[1fr,400px]`
- Issue: Tailwind v4 grid syntax wasn't working

**Final Solution**:
- Switched to flexbox: `flex flex-col lg:flex-row`
- Video preview: `flex-1` (takes remaining space)
- Controls panel: `lg:w-[400px] lg:flex-shrink-0` (fixed width on desktop)
- Made controls sticky on desktop: `lg:sticky lg:top-8 lg:self-start`
- Mobile: Stacked vertical layout (`flex-col`)
- Desktop: Side-by-side layout (`lg:flex-row`)

**Responsive Breakpoints**:
- Padding: `p-4 sm:p-6`
- Spacing: `gap-6 lg:gap-8`, `space-y-4 lg:space-y-6`
- Text sizes: `text-3xl sm:text-4xl lg:text-5xl`
- Container padding: `px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8`

### 5. Repository Preparation
**Instruction**: "Fix it. Update context and prepare the repo to be committed with appropriate dot files"

**Files Created**:
1. **README.md**: User-facing documentation with features, setup, deployment
2. **CLAUDE.md**: AI assistant context for future development
3. **.gitattributes**: Line ending normalization for cross-platform
4. **.gitignore**: Already existed, excludes node_modules, dist, etc.

**Commit Made**:
```

- 30 files changed, 5,401 insertions(+)
```

### 6. GitHub Actions Workflow
**Instruction**: "Add the workflows that allow the application to be published to gh-pages"

**Implementation**:
- Created `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- Uses GitHub Actions to build and deploy on push to main
- Two-job workflow: build → deploy
- Updated README with setup instructions

**Key Features**:
- Auto-deployment on push to main

**This File**: Created to capture session context and decisions

## Technical Implementation Details

### FFmpeg.wasm Integration

**Loading Strategy**:
```typescript
const baseURL = 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@ffmpeg/core@0.12.6/dist/esm';
await ffmpeg.load({
  coreURL: await toBlobURL(`${baseURL}/ffmpeg-core.js`, 'text/javascript'),
  wasmURL: await toBlobURL(`${baseURL}/ffmpeg-core.wasm`, 'application/wasm'),
});
```

**Conversion Command**:
```typescript
await ffmpeg.exec([
  '-i', 'input.mp4',
  '-ss', start.toString(),
  '-t', duration.toString(),
  '-vf', `fps=${fps},scale=${width}:-1:flags=lanczos`,
  '-gifflags', '+transdiff',
  '-y',
  'output.gif'
]);
```

**Data Handling**:
```typescript
const data = await ffmpeg.readFile('output.gif');
return new Blob([data.buffer as ArrayBuffer], { type: 'image/gif' });
```

### Component Architecture

**Pages**:
- `Home.tsx`: Landing page with file uploader
- `Editor.tsx`: Main editor orchestrating all components

**Key Components**:
- `FileUploader.tsx`: Drag-and-drop with validation
- `VideoPlayer.tsx`: HTML5 video with custom controls
- `TimeRangeSelector.tsx`: Dual-handle time range picker
- `GifGenerator.tsx`: FFmpeg conversion (currently unused, logic in Editor)
- `GifPreview.tsx`: Display and download generated GIF

**Hooks**:
- `useFFmpeg.ts`: FFmpeg lifecycle management with useCallback
- `useVideoMetadata.ts`: Extract video metadata

**Utilities**:
- `fileValidation.ts`: File type and size validation
- `timeFormatting.ts`: Time conversion and validation
- `videoProcessing.ts`: FFmpeg conversion logic
- `cn.ts`: Tailwind class merging utility

### State Management Pattern

1. User uploads file in `Home` page
2. Navigate to `Editor` with file via router state
3. `Editor` coordinates:
   - Video playback (VideoPlayer)
   - Time selection (TimeRangeSelector)
   - Settings and generation (inline logic)
   - Preview (GifPreview)
4. FFmpeg loaded lazily when entering Editor
5. Progress tracked via `ffmpeg.on('progress')`

## Configuration Notes

### Vite Configuration
```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  base: '/video-gif-creator/', // Must match repo name
  plugins: [react()],
  optimizeDeps: {
    exclude: ['@ffmpeg/ffmpeg', '@ffmpeg/util'], // Critical for FFmpeg
  },
});
```

### TailwindCSS v4 Setup
```css
/* src/index.css */
@import "tailwindcss"; /* NOT @tailwind directives */
```

```javascript
// postcss.config.js
export default {
  plugins: {
    '@tailwindcss/postcss': {}, // NOT 'tailwindcss'
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
```

### Package.json Scripts
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "tsc && vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
  }
}
```

## Design Decisions

### Why Flexbox Over Grid?
- TailwindCSS v4 had issues with complex grid syntax `lg:grid-cols-[1fr,400px]`
- Flexbox provided more reliable responsive behavior
- Easier to understand and maintain

### Why jsDelivr Over unpkg?
- Better CORS support
- More reliable for WebAssembly files
- Recommended by FFmpeg.wasm documentation

### Why useCallback in useFFmpeg?
- Prevents infinite re-render loops
- Ensures `load` function reference stability
- Critical for proper useEffect dependencies

### Why HashRouter?
- GitHub Pages doesn't support client-side routing with BrowserRouter
- HashRouter works without server configuration
- URLs look like: `https://example.com/#/editor`

## User Experience Decisions

### Time Range Validation
- Warning if duration > 10 seconds (large file size)
- Validation: start < end, within video duration
- Visual feedback with color-coded alerts

### File Size Warnings
- Warn if video > 100MB
- Display file size in human-readable format
- Show estimated GIF dimensions

### Progress Feedback
- Loading states during FFmpeg initialization
- Progress bar during conversion (0-100%)
- Sticky controls on desktop for visibility

### Mobile-First Design
- Single column on mobile
- Side-by-side on desktop (lg breakpoint)
- Touch-friendly controls
- Responsive text sizes and spacing

## Deployment Setup

### GitHub Pages via Actions
1. Update `base` in `vite.config.ts` to repo name
2. Push to GitHub
3. Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions
4. Workflow auto-deploys on push to main

### Manual Deployment
```bash
npm run deploy  # Uses gh-pages package
```
Then set Pages source to `gh-pages` branch

## Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: TailwindCSS Not Loading
**Symptom**: Icons huge, no styling
**Cause**: Using v3 syntax in v4
**Solution**: Use `@import "tailwindcss"` and `@tailwindcss/postcss`

### Issue 2: FFmpeg Loading Failed
**Symptom**: "Error: failed to import ffmpeg-core.js"
**Cause**: CORS issues with unpkg
**Solution**: Switch to jsDelivr CDN

### Issue 3: Loading Button Not Changing
**Symptom**: Button stuck on "Initializing..."
**Cause**: Infinite re-renders from unstable function reference
**Solution**: Wrap `load` in useCallback

### Issue 4: Layout Not Side-by-Side
**Symptom**: Controls always below preview
**Cause**: Grid syntax not working in Tailwind v4
**Solution**: Use flexbox with proper flex properties

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
- Multiple format exports (WebP, animated PNG)
- Preset templates (Twitter, Discord optimized)
- Local storage for settings persistence
- Video thumbnail extraction
- Batch conversion support
- Real-time preview of GIF output

### Performance Optimizations

```

### 8. Blob URL Management Issues (October 3, 2025)
**Issue**: "after selecting a file, i see a error in console like: GET blob:https://jagadish-k.github.io/... net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND. It repeats continuously."

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- React StrictMode in development double-mounts components
- VideoPlayer creates blob URL → cleanup revokes it → browser tries to load revoked URL
- Continuous ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND errors in console
- Video player would flicker and sometimes fail to display

**Investigation Process**:
1. Added detailed logging to track blob URL lifecycle
2. Identified that blob URLs were being created and revoked 3-4 times per file load
3. Discovered StrictMode's mount-unmount-remount cycle was triggering cleanup functions
4. Tried several approaches: delayed revocation, ref-based tracking, Map cache

**Failed Approaches**:
- ❌ Delayed revocation with setTimeout (still revoked too early)
- ❌ Component-level refs (new instances created on each mount)
- ❌ Empty dependency useEffect cleanup (still triggered in StrictMode)

**Final Solution**:
Implemented module-level cache that survives component re-mounts:

```typescript
// Module-level - persists across component instances
const blobCache = {
  file: null as File | null,
  url: null as string | null,
};

// In useEffect:
if (blobCache.file === videoFile && blobCache.url) {
  video.src = blobCache.url; // Reuse existing URL
  return;
}

// Only create new URL for new files
const url = URL.createObjectURL(videoFile);
blobCache.file = videoFile;
blobCache.url = url;
video.src = url;

// No cleanup - cache persists across re-mounts
```

**Key Insights**:
- Module-level variables survive React component lifecycle
- File reference identity (`===`) reliably detects same vs different files
- Removing cleanup functions prevents premature revocation
- Separate temporary blob URLs for metadata extraction

**Commit Made**:

- 5 files changed, 139 insertions(+), 101 deletions(-)
```

### 9. Mobile UI Optimization (October 3, 2025)
**Issue**: "the three tiles at the top: Fast & Easy, 100% Private and Customisable take up too much vertical space on a mobile screen as you have to scroll down to get to the upload area"

**Solution Implemented**:
- Changed feature tiles to horizontal layout on mobile
- Icons and titles side-by-side: `flex sm:flex-col`
- Hidden descriptions on mobile: `hidden sm:block`
- Reduced padding: `p-3 sm:p-6`
- Smaller icons: `w-10 h-10 sm:w-12 sm:h-12`
- Reduced spacing: `gap-3 sm:gap-6`, `mb-6 sm:mb-12`

**Mobile Layout**:
```
[Icon] Title    (compact horizontal)
[Icon] Title
[Icon] Title
```

**Desktop Layout**:
```
[Icon]          [Icon]          [Icon]
Title           Title           Title
Description     Description     Description
```

**Impact**: Reduced vertical space by ~40% on mobile, upload area now visible without scrolling

- Complete CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Comprehensive documentation (README, CLAUDE.md, vibe-code-instructions.md)
- Production-ready mobile-responsive design

**Critical Learning: React StrictMode & Blob URLs**
- Module-level caching is essential for blob URLs in React apps
- Component-level refs don't survive StrictMode's double-mounting
- File reference identity (`===`) is reliable for cache validation
- Metadata extraction should use separate temporary blob URLs
- No cleanup functions needed when cache manages lifecycle

The application is now production-ready and deployable to GitHub Pages with automated CI/CD. This demonstrates the power of AI-assisted development - what traditionally takes days was accomplished in 2 hours through effective human-AI collaboration, including debugging complex React lifecycle issues.
