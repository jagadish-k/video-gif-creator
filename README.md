# GIF Maker

> ü§ñ **Built with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)** - This entire application was developed through an AI-assisted coding session, showcasing the power of collaborative development between human creativity and AI capabilities.

A modern, browser-based video to GIF converter built with React, TypeScript, and FFmpeg.wasm. Convert videos to GIFs entirely in your browser - no uploads, completely private.

## üéØ About This Project

This project demonstrates what's possible when combining human vision with AI-assisted development. Using Claude Code, we built a full-featured video-to-GIF converter in a single focused development session, including:

- Complete project scaffolding from specifications
- Responsive UI with TailwindCSS v4
- Client-side video processing with FFmpeg.wasm
- Smart GIF optimization algorithms
- Automated GitHub Pages deployment

The development process emphasized iterative refinement, with the AI understanding requirements, implementing solutions, and adapting based on real-time feedback - showcasing modern AI-assisted software development.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: React Router v6 (HashRouter for GitHub Pages)
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS v4
- **Video Processing**: FFmpeg.wasm
- **Build Tool**: Vite

## üìñ How to Use

1. **Upload a video** - Drag and drop or click to browse (MP4, WebM, MOV, AVI)
2. **Select time range** - Choose the start and end time for your GIF
3. **Adjust settings**:
   - Frame rate (10-25 FPS)
   - Quality preset (480p, 720p, 1080p)
   - Custom width with aspect ratio maintained
4. **Generate GIF** - Click generate and wait for processing
5. **Download** - Save your GIF or create another

## üåê Deployment

### GitHub Pages (Automated with GitHub Actions)

**Setup (one-time):**

1. Update `base` in `vite.config.ts` to match your repository name:
   ```ts
   base: '/your-repo-name/'
   ```

2. Push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/video-gif-creator.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings:
   - Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Pages**
   - Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
   - The workflow will automatically deploy on push to main

**Manual Deployment (alternative):**

```bash
npm run deploy  # Deploys to gh-pages branch
```

Then set GitHub Pages source to `gh-pages` branch in settings.

- Iterative problem-solving (TailwindCSS v4 migration, FFmpeg CORS issues, responsive layout challenges)
- Real-time debugging and optimization
- Human feedback driving AI implementation

**Key achievements:**
- ~6,000+ lines of code
- 30+ files created
- 9 commits with detailed documentation
- Multiple architectural decisions documented
- Complete deployment pipeline
- Built in **~1.5 hours** of development time

**Development metrics:**
